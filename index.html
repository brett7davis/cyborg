    <p class = "white-text text-left thin-red-border"> Cyborg was born on 9 July 1985 in Curitiba, Brazil.  In 2004 after she competed in a high school handball championship game, she was approached by Rudimar Fedrigo, the founder and head coach of Chute Boxe Academy. Fedrigo was impressed by her strength and athleticism and encouraged a hesitant Santos to become a fighter. At the Chute Boxe Academy, Santos fell in love with the sport and met her future husband, Evangelista Santos.  Her first professional fight wasn't until May 2005.
